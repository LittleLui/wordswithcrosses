Robo Crosswords
===============

*Robo Crosswords* is a free, open-source crossword puzzle app for Android.  It was forked from [*Shortyz Crosswords*](https://github.com/kebernet/shortyz) by Robert Cooper.

*Robo Crosswords* was formerly known as *Words With Crosses*, until in 2017, I was demanded by Zynga to change the name.  This app has never been associated with or related to Zynga or its app *Words With Friends*.

If you'd like to support the continued development of *Robo Crosswords*, [please donate](http://adamrosenfield.com/donate).  This is a side project of mine done in my spare time, outside of my day job.
